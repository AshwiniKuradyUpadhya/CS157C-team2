# CS157C-team2

## Overview

This is a housing website named as "The Sunshine" Apartments. The front end is designed by using HTML, CSS, Javascript. DynamoDB is chosen as a backend database and Server-side application is written in DJango(Python) framework. We used Boto3 libraries to communicate with Dynamo DB database to make the application responsive. The application is listening on local port: 8080 when we run the command for manage.py from the terminal.


## Project Structure

AWS CLI installed with aws configuration for dynamoDB webservices.

By creating a Django project, Django creates a config directory for the project called "residential portal" which consists of files such as "_init_.py", "asgi.py", "settings.py", "urls.py", "wsgi.py"

We created an app directory called "dashboard" which consists of all files required for the main application of our project such as "_init_.py", "admins.py", "apps.py", "models.py", "tests.py", "urls.py" and "view.py"

dashboard/template/portal is where the .html files go.
.html files are as below:

amenities.html
amenities_reservation.html
dashboard.html
employeepage.html
FAQ.html
floorplans.html
gallery.html
importantn_numbers.html
index.html
maintenance.html
pay.html
payment_redirect.html
userpage.html


static/images/ is where images go. Syntax for images in .html is {% static '............' %} ex:
```
<img src="{% static 'images/homemarquee4.png' %}" alt="first" style="width:100%;">
```

dashboard/views.py is where we load the different views with any backend functions.

dashboard/urls.py is where we add our different paths.

Connection follows the below path for the home page:
```
residential portal/urls.py -> dashboard/urls.py -> '/' gets accessed from dashboard/views.py -> request is passed to "index.html"(home page)
```
